# Executive Summary

## Pygmalion / C.R.I.S.T.A.L.L.

Pygmalion / C.R.I.S.T.A.L.L. is a social-technology startup of the **7th technological wave (Noonomics)**, focused on developing a numerical platform for recognizing and accounting **non-material human value**.

### The Problem

Modern economic and digital systems are highly effective at measuring price, productivity, and performance. However, they systematically fail to recognize forms of value that are essential for social sustainability: participation, trust, gratitude, care, and conscious contribution. As a result, many meaningful human actions remain invisible, unaccounted for, or distorted by monetary and KPI-driven logic.

### The Solution

Pygmalion explores an alternative approach. The project develops a **NOD-platform (Noosphere–Society–Spirituality)** that enables the recognition of non-material value without converting it into money, obligation, or debt. The platform is designed not as a system of control, optimization, or coercion, but as an **ethical navigation environment** that helps individuals and communities reflect on the consequences of their actions while preserving freedom, dignity, and responsibility.

### Core Technology: TIUP

At the core of the platform lies **TIUP (Human-Centered Technology of Behavioral Navigation)**. TIUP does not manage people or enforce compliance. Instead, it provides instruments for orientation: making visible the non-material impact of actions and interactions. The system explicitly rejects punitive mechanisms, forced participation, and the treatment of humans as resources.

### Platform Architecture

The platform architecture consists of three layers:

1. **Pygmalion** — an initial NOD-environment where individuals can record conscious actions, acts of gratitude, and forms of participation, creating a non-material footprint.

2. **C.R.I.S.T.A.L.L.** — a numerical but non-monetary accounting core that registers recognition and trust without accumulation or speculation. Accounting units cannot be stored; they can only be transferred.

3. **"Flower of Life" NOD-Sphere** (in development) — an evaluative and ethical layer intended to integrate human biological, social, and cognitive functions into a coherent framework of non-material value.

### Ethics as Governance

Ethics is not an add-on but a governing layer of the system. 
- Voluntary action is never mandatory;
- Gratitude never creates debt;
- Harm to human dignity is prohibited even when it appears logically efficient.
- Certain socially critical domains—such as education, care, and protection—are intentionally placed in **non-accounting zones**.

### Current Status

Within approximately 1.5 months, the project has produced **two working MVPs (online and offline)**, demonstrating the feasibility of non-monetary accounting as a reflective and social tool. Pygmalion is currently in an **open research and architectural phase**, inviting developers, researchers, practitioners, and ethical thinkers to co-create a new type of social infrastructure beyond coercive economic models.

### Vision

We invite participation from:
- **Researchers** testing post-economic models
- **Developers** building ethical technology
- **Practitioners** implementing new forms of recognition
- **Systems thinkers** exploring post-growth futures
- **Ethical innovators** reimagining social value

Pygmalion is a research platform and a living experiment—not a finished product, but an invitation to imagine and build what comes after the age of purely monetary accounting.
