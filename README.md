**Pygmalion / C.R.I.S.T.A.L.L.** is a social-tech startup of the **7th technological wave (Noonomics)**.

The project develops a numerical **NOD-platform** for recognizing and accounting **non-material human value**: participation, trust, gratitude, and conscious contribution — beyond money, coercion, and KPI-driven logic.

---

## 🌍 Project Idea

Modern systems are good at measuring **price**, but poor at recognizing **value**.

**Pygmalion** explores an alternative environment where:
- value is not reduced to money;
- contribution does not become debt;
- gratitude is not treated as exchange.

This is a research and engineering attempt to answer a key question:
**what could social infrastructure look like after coercive economic models?**

---

## 👥 Who Is This Project For?

Pygmalion / C.R.I.S.T.A.L.L. is open to different roles and forms of participation:

- **Researchers** — a living laboratory for testing post-economic accounting models and non-monetary units of value.
- **Developers** — participation in building a NOD-platform, ethical interfaces, and alternative accounting architectures.
- **Practitioners** (education, therapy, communities) — tools for recognizing participation, trust, and gratitude beyond money and KPIs.
- **Systems thinkers** — working with the 7th technological wave not as theory, but as a live prototype.
- **Investors / philanthropists** — early involvement in a new type of social infrastructure, independent from political or party systems.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts (Brief)

- **7th Technological Wave / Noonomics** — a post-economic development concept prioritizing human potential and knowledge over capital growth (see works by Prof. S. D. Bodrunov).
- **NOD (Noosphere, Society, Spirituality)** — a form of interaction based on voluntary participation and responsibility.
- **Non-material value** — human contribution that cannot be expressed in money but has real social significance.

## 🗠 Core Technology

### TIUP (Human-Centered)
**TIUP (Technology of Instruments for Human-Centered Behavioral Navigation)** 
is not a system of control, but of orientation.

TIUP:
- does not coerce;
- does not punish;
- does not optimize humans as resources.

It helps people **see the consequences of actions** while preserving freedom of choice, dignity, and meaning.

## 🗱 Platform Architecture

### 1. Initial NOD-Environment — *Pygmalion*
A personal space for:
- conscious actions;
- acts of gratitude;
- formation of a non-material participation footprint.

### 2. Accounting NOD-System — *C.R.I.S.T.A.L.L.*
A numerical but **non-monetary** core:
- recording acts of recognition and trust;
- no accumulation or speculation;
- open registry of accounting markers.

> Accounting units cannot be stored — only transferred.

### 3. NOD-Sphere "Flower of Life" *(in development)* 
See `/docs` for updated concepts.

## 🌱 Ethics & Safeguards

- voluntary action is never mandatory;
- gratitude does not create debt;
- **Non-accounting zones** exist in socially critical areas (education, care, protection);
- harm to human dignity is unacceptable, even if it appears logically efficient.

Ethical principles override technical and economic mechanisms. 
Details: see `/docs/ethics.md`.

---

## 🚀 Project Status

- **2 MVPs** built in ~1.5 months;
- online version: React;
- offline version: HTML / CSS / JS;
- current stage: open research and architectural development.

---

## ✅ What Already Works (MVP)

At this stage, the platform allows users to:
- record acts of participation and gratitude in non-monetary form;
- see a non-material footprint without turning it into obligation;
- operate accounting units (first contour only, without accumulation);
- use the system online and offline;
- apply MVPs as reflection and discussion tools in small groups.

This is a **working prototype**, not a finished product — intended for pilots and co-development.

## 🤟 How to Join

You can contribute to the project right now:

- create an Issue with an idea, question, or use-case;
- propose a pilot group or TIUP scenario;
- help with development (frontend / backend);
- assist with EN documentation and translations;
- participate in research or ethical texts.

Currently needed:
frontend developers, systems thinkers, facilitators, translators, data & ethics-focused legal experts.

Contact channel will be added separately. 
The project remains outside political parties and traditional economic logic.

## 🛣 Bridge to the Economy


While gratitude does not constitute an automatic exchange, the Record Marker (R.M.) may be subject to voluntary valuation by participants seeking to engage with the real economy of the Sixth Order.

1.	The NOD platform is a mirror, not a judge. The architecture of C.R.I.S.T.A.L.L. does not award points for «good behaviour» and does not generate market quotes. This is what "Numerical Restraint" means.
2.	The participant is a sovereign. Only someone who has received the R.M. (Record Marker) has the right to decide what this marker is worth in their life (nominal value, work, product).
3.	Evaluation is not coercion. Assessing the marker in terms of resources and exchanging it for those resources is an act of goodwill between two parties, not a systemic requirement.
4.	Transfer at «face value». This is provided for in the scenarios (e.g., Scenario 01), where a participant (Dima) evaluates the received markers in terms of «honey» or «snow removal» and transfers them to the performer in exchange for completing the task.
