  "description": "An accounting-and-learning platform of progressive noonomics. The MVP explores non-material human values — participation, trust, gratitude, and conscious contribution — beyond money, coercion, and KPI logic. The project follows the path of numerical restraint, aiming to reduce digital inequality, dependencies, and forms of voluntary submission.",

  "mvp_title": "Minimum Viable Product (MVP)",
  "mvp_description": "The MVP demonstrates the possibility of accounting for non-material human participation without ratings, accumulation, or competition. The focus is on the person, their choice, and their action — not their utility to the system.",

  "mvp_kon_title": "Kon and daily recording",
  "mvp_kon_body": "The MVP uses a kon table — a simple form of daily recording. One kon equals one day. Facts of participation and transfer of non-material units are recorded without interpretation, evaluation, or sanctions.",

  "mvp_values_title": "System of non-material values",
  "mvp_values_body": "The project is grounded in non-material spiritual values and the principle of numerical restraint. Its aim is to reduce dependence on financial mechanisms, wage servitude, accumulation, coercion, systemic education, political and ethnic division, as well as forms of tribal consciousness.",

  "mvp_meaning_title": "Meaning of the MVP",
  "mvp_meaning_body": "The MVP does not propose a utopia and does not impose a path. It creates a neutral environment where voluntary labor is fully liberated, and meaning emerges later — through reflection on lived days, not at the moment of action.",

  "mvp_future_title": "Further development",
  "mvp_future_body": "After the MVP phase, a final table will be formed across all kons (days) in two MVP versions. It exists solely for analysis and understanding, without influencing participant behavior."
